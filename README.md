# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classifier
A Deep Learning neural network capable of classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

This is accomplished by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the inputs of handwritten digit images.

The hidden layers of the network is composed of convolution layers and pooling layers.
